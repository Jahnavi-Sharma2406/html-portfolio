<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Jahnavi Sharma. I'm 17years old. I have just started learning about coding and web development. So far im enjoying the process of learning about it and hopefully i can perhaps pursue a career out of this and get paid well for it as I'm going to take up on a course on comp sci engineering(STEM girly) for college. All the best to me!</p>
